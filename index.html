                <h2><span> About Me</span></h2>
                <b>I am Albert Assoulin</b>
                <p>I was born in Morocco in the city of Casablanca in 1943. </p>
                <p>I studied in a French elementary school where we studied arithmetic, Arabic, Hebrew and Torah. After that I moved to a religious yeshiva that was among the best places to study.</p>
                <p> During my years of study I was a very diligent student with excellent results, of course I loved studying mathematics and I knew all the Torah in Papt. </p>
                <p>In Morocco, the government was a monarchical government ruled by a king, there are several events that I remember from my childhood, I will tell you about two of them: </p>
                <p>One is that one day King Nasser of Egypt came to Morocco for a visit, and this event greatly affected our Arab neighbors who lived with us because it caused unrest and there was a terrible fear of walking around the streets and shopping.</p>
                <p>The second event is the death of the king of Morocco, I remember the king's funeral procession, how the whole country was shocked and everyone came to accompany him on his last journey, and how all the Jews were terribly afraid that now another king would arise make their life in Morocco miserable. But that also passed us by peacefully.</p>
                <p>Life in Morocco looked like this. The neighborhoods were made up in the shape of an animal with residential buildings around and in the middle there was a large yard in the center of which was a kitchen and a tabon shower that all the neighbors would use in common. </p>
                <p>When I was a child we didn't have water from the taps, but there was a man who came and sold us water in a jerry can. In our neighborhood we lived next door to Jews and Arabs, we had a very good neighborliness we learned to get along with the neighbors and we were good friends. Our Arab neighbors knew how to respect us on holidays and Saturdays and so do we.</p>
                <p>As children we played together in the streets and led a completely normal neighborhood life. My parents in Morocco did not work because my father became blind at the age of 17 while working as a teacher, but since his blindness he began to teach children Torah because he knew it by heart. He also worked and studied Gemara and Talmud. Grandfather Albert came to Israel and enlisted in the army when he was 18 years old and married, he was drafted into the Armored Corps, later the Six Day War began and he participated in the war on the Egyptian front, where he was wounded in the leg. A hand that caused many surgeries and a year's hospitalization in Soroka Hospital.</p>
                <p>This injury caused grandfather Albert to become self-employed, and since then he has been selling food products (at the cinema, in Sibi Dimona, a grocery store in town, a cinema shop, a photo shop). Grandpa Albert loved to travel the world, he combined the trips with flights, cruises. Another hobby he had was getting together with friends and playing a card game - a Moroccan game.</p>

                <h2><span>Q&A</span></h2>
                <p>1. Three main differences between web1, web2, and web3:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Web1:</strong> In web1, the internet is defined as a collection of linked and simple documents, primarily within academic and research communities...</li>
                    <li><strong>Web2:</strong> In web2, the internet evolves into a more dynamic platform where users can create, share, and interact with content...</li>
                    <li><strong>Web3:</strong> Web3 represents the next evolution of the internet, focusing on decentralization, blockchain technology, and user control over data...</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>2. Explanation with an example:</p>
                <ul> 
                    <li>For instance, when searching for "side effects of drugs" on web1, the results might consist of static web pages created by authoritative sources like medical institutions or government agencies...</li>
                    <li>On web2, the same search query may lead to results from various sources, including forums, blogs, and social media platforms, where individuals share personal experiences and insights about drug side effects...</li>
                    <li>In contrast, web3 platforms might utilize blockchain technology to provide verified and tamper-proof information about drug side effects...</li>
