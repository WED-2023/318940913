                <h2><span> About Me</span></h2>
                <b>I am Albert Assoulin</b>
                <br>
                <br>I was born in Morocco in the city of Casablanca in 1943. 
                <br>
                <br>I studied in a French elementary school where we studied arithmetic, Arabic, Hebrew and Torah. After that I moved to a religious yeshiva that was among the best places to study.
                <br>
                <br> During my years of study I was a very diligent student with excellent results, of course I loved studying mathematics and I knew all the Torah in Papt. 
                <br>
                <br>In Morocco, the government was a monarchical government ruled by a king, there are several events that I remember from my childhood, I will tell you about two of them: 
                <br>
                <br>One is that one day King Nasser of Egypt came to Morocco for a visit, and this event greatly affected our Arab neighbors who lived with us because it caused unrest and there was a terrible fear of walking around the streets and shopping.
                <br>
                <br>The second event is the death of the king of Morocco, I remember the king's funeral procession, how the whole country was shocked and everyone came to accompany him on his last journey, and how all the Jews were terribly afraid that now another king would arise make their life in Morocco miserable. But that also passed us by peacefully.
                <br>
                <br>Life in Morocco looked like this. The neighborhoods were made up in the shape of an animal with residential buildings around and in the middle there was a large yard in the center of which was a kitchen and a tabon shower that all the neighbors would use in common. 
                <br>
                <br>When I was a child we didn't have water from the taps, but there was a man who came and sold us water in a jerry can. In our neighborhood we lived next door to Jews and Arabs, we had a very good neighborliness we learned to get along with the neighbors and we were good friends. Our Arab neighbors knew how to respect us on holidays and Saturdays and so do we.
                <br>
                <br>As children we played together in the streets and led a completely normal neighborhood life. My parents in Morocco did not work because my father became blind at the age of 17 while working as a teacher, but since his blindness he began to teach children Torah because he knew it by heart. He also worked and studied Gemara and Talmud. Grandfather Albert came to Israel and enlisted in the army when he was 18 years old and married, he was drafted into the Armored Corps, later the Six Day War began and he participated in the war on the Egyptian front, where he was wounded in the leg. A hand that caused many surgeries and a year's hospitalization in Soroka Hospital.
                <br>
                <br>This injury caused grandfather Albert to become self-employed, and since then he has been selling food products (at the cinema, in Sibi Dimona, a grocery store in town, a cinema shop, a photo shop). Grandpa Albert loved to travel the world, he combined the trips with flights, cruises. Another hobby he had was getting together with friends and playing a card game - a Moroccan game.

                <h2><span>Q&A</span></h2>
                <h3> 3 הבדלים עיקריים בין web1,web2 ו web3 : </h3>
                <br><b> הבדל באופי התוכן ואינטרקציה :</b>
                <br> web1 : מאופיין בתוכן סטטי לקריאה בלבד. משתמשים יכלו להציג מידע רק ללא יכולת ליצור אינטראקציה.
                <br> web2 : מאופיין על ידי תוכן דינמי ואינטראקציה עם המשתמש. פלטפורמות כגון מדיה חברתית, בלוגים וויקיס צצו, המאפשרות למשתמשים ליצור, לשתף ולקיים אינטראקציה עם תוכן.
                <br> web3 : מתמקד בביזור האינטרנט, תוך מינוף טכנולוגיות כמו בלוקצ'יין. מטרתו היא ליצור אינטרנט אינטליגנטי ומקושר יותר שבו נתונים מקושרים זה לזה בצורה משמעותית.    
                <br>
                <br><b> הבדל בשליטה במידע ובקרה :</b>
                <br> web1 :הנתונים הם בעיקר בבעלות ובשליטה של בעלי אתרים. למשתמשים יש שליטה מינימלית על אופן השימוש או האחסון בנתונים שלהם.
                <br> web2 : בעוד שמשתמשים מייצרים כמות משמעותית של תוכן, פלטפורמות מרכזיות גדולות (כמו פייסבוק, גוגל וכו') שולטות בנתונים אלה ומייצרים רווחים. למשתמשים יש יותר אינטראקציה אך עדיין שליטה מוגבלת על הנתונים האישיים שלהם.
                <br>  web3 : תומך בביזור שבו למשתמשים יש בעלות ושליטה רבה יותר על הנתונים שלהם. טכנולוגיית בלוקצ'יין ויישומים מבוזרים (dApps) מאפשרים למשתמשים להחזיק בנכסים ובזהויות הדיגיטליות שלהם, מה שמפחית את התלות ברשויות מרכזיות.
                <br>
                <br><b> הבדל בטכנולוגיה :</b>
                <br> web1 : בנוי על HTML, CSS וטכנולוגיות אינטרנט מוקדמות בסיסיות. ההתמקדות הייתה בהצגת מידע ולא באינטראקציה.
                <br> web2 :משתמש בטכנולוגיות אינטרנט מתקדמות כמו AJAX, JavaScript וממשקי API כדי ליצור יישומי אינטרנט אינטראקטיביים ומגיבים יותר. הוא מסתמך במידה רבה על שרתים ומסדי נתונים מרכזיים.
                <br> web3 : משתמש בבלוקצ'יין, חוזים חכמים ורשתות מבוזרות. טכנולוגיות כמו בינה מלאכותית ולמידת מכונה משחקות גם הן תפקיד משמעותי בהפיכת האינטרנט לאינטליגנטי יותר ומגיב לצרכי המשתמשים. פתרונות אחסון ופרוטוקולים מבוזרים (כמו IPFS) משמשים להפצת נתונים ברחבי הרשת.
                <br>

                <h3> Use case : רשתות חברתיות</h3>
                <br><b> Web 1 :</b>
                <br>תרחיש: דן רוצה ליצור נוכחות מקוונת כדי לשתף עדכונים עם חברים ובני משפחה.
                <br> יישום: דן מקים דף בית אישי באמצעות HTML בסיסי, בו הוא מפרסם עדכונים ותמונות.
                <br> חווית משתמש: חברים ובני משפחה יכולים לבקר בדף של דן כדי לראות את העדכונים שלו, אבל האינטראקציה מוגבלת לצפייה בתוכן ושליחת מיילים.

                <br><b> Web 2 : </b>
                <br> תרחיש: דן רוצה ליצור אינטראקציה דינמית יותר עם רשת רחבה יותר של אנשים.
                <br> יישום: דן מצטרף לפייסבוק, שם הוא יוצר פרופיל, מפרסם עדכונים, משתף תמונות ומקיים אינטראקציה עם חברים באמצעות תגובות, לייקים והודעות.
                <br> חווית משתמש: דן נהנה מחוויה אינטראקטיבית עשירה, חיבור עם חברים, הצטרפות לקבוצות ועיסוק במגוון תכנים. עם זאת, הנתונים שלו נשלטים ומונטיזציה על ידי הפלטפורמה.

                <br><b> Web 3 : </b>
                <br> תרחיש: דן רוצה לשלוט בנתונים האישיים שלו ולהבטיח שהאינטראקציות המקוונות שלו יהיו פרטיות ומאובטחות.
                <br> יישום: דן מצטרף לרשת חברתית מבוזרת כמו Mastodon. הנתונים שלו מאוחסנים בשרת מאוחד לפי בחירתו, והוא מקיים אינטראקציה עם אחרים באופן עמית לעמית.
                <br> חווית משתמש: לדן יש שליטה מלאה על הנתונים והפרטיות שלו. הוא מקיים אינטראקציה עם אחרים ללא חשש מכריית נתונים או צנזורה. האופי המבוזר של הפלטפורמה מבטיח אבטחה ובעלות רבה יותר על הזהות הדיגיטלית שלו.
